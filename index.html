        <h1>Hello, I'm Ashley...</h1>
        <p>Up until October 2021, I was working for a startup health tech company as a Senior Product Operations Specialist. I worked right under the Director of Product Operations. For almost three years I helped with product launches, updates, and maintenance. However, I felt like something was missing. I wasn’t feeling satisfied anymore, I felt like I my professional life was at a standstill. I knew I needed to do something about it. Rewind back to August 2021, after much research and talking to many professionals, I took an interest in software engineering. From there, I went to codecademy.com and starting learning. Seeing “Hello World” printed in the browser, knowing that I built that in there had me feeling exhilarated! I’ve never in my life felt that type of excitement when it came to my professional career. I knew that it was a sign that this was the next step for me. Fast forward to November 22nd, 2021 I will be starting Flatiron School’s Full Time Software Engineering Immersive. Check out my GitHub and LinkedIn pages to follow along my journey!</p>
